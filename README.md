# Colemak Minimal

These are the vim keybindings that I settled on after
switching to the colemak keyboard layout.

The bindings try to change as little as possible, only trying
to preserve the "home-row" feel of the default bindings.
Here are the keys that are swapped:

h & n  
k & i  
j & e  
l & o  

Movement is set up to be by visual lines, not file lines (i.e. i -> gk).

If you want to support some plugins, please send me a request,
and happy colemak hacking!
